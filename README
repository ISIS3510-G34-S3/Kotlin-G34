This is the repository for the Kotlin frontend development.

All views can be seen from the develop branch except for the Map View, which due to conflicts had to remain in the feature/mapview-#1 branch. However, from this branch all views are observable and navigatable.

3 of the 4 views are together in the develop branch. This views are tied to the ms7 release on the develop branch.
1 view, i.e. the map view, is separately in the feature/mapview-#1 branch due to last minute merge conflicts. This view is associated to the ms7MapView release on the corresponding branch.
